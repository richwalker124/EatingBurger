TODO:
1. Develop front end, make it look (ok).
2.Use Jquery to dynamically generate buttons/burger boxes, but create an example in the html.
3.Add functionality to back end, so the data can properly be transferred. (not really a step so much as it is a move from front end to back end)
4.Create Database.
5.Find out whats needed for ORM, do that next.
6.Add routing logic (unless this needs to be done earlier)
7.
